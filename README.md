# RRPathVisualizer
Path visualizer to animate RoadRunner paths<br><br>
Ported to be compatible and seamless with our home-brewed [BunyipsLib](https://github.com/Murray-Bridge-Bunyips/BunyipsLib) FTC library.
Some features found in BunyipsLib are not represented here, including individual task construction, auto-mirrored trajectories, sequence markers and constraint-based paths. This tool is mainly designed for quick visualisations of individual trajectories, rather than full Autonomous routines.
